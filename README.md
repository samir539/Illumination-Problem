# Illumination-Problem
This project looks to investigate the nature of illumination experienced by a horizontal road by two lamps at either side of the road.

This project looks to investigate the nature of illumination experienced by a horizontal road by two lamps at either side of the road (the lights being opposite one another). Knowing how high to place the lamps as well as their optimal power output are crucial for achieving a homogeneous illumination of the road. Achieving such homogeneous illumination is crucial, principally for concerns of safety. Wide roads often suffer from inhomogenous illumination and this investigation looks to model the situation to obtain insights into optimal lamp placement and power.
